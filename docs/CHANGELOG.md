### Security Features
- All secrets managed through Google Secret Manager
- JWT tokens with configurable expiration
- TLS 1.3 for all communications
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Regular security scanning with Docker Scout

### Cost Optimization
- Cloudflare R2 storage: ~$1.35/month vs $2.30+ for S3
- Intelligent auto-shutdown: 10-minute idle timeout
- Redis caching: 20-30% efficiency improvement
- Serverless scaling: Pay only for actual usage
- Monthly operational cost: ~$1,749 with all features

### Dependencies
- **Python**: 3.11+
- **PyTorch**: 2.1.0+ with CUDA 12.1 support
- **FastAPI**: 0.104.0+ for API framework

### Known Issues
- GPU memory fragmentation on long-running instances (workaround: periodic restart)
- WebSocket connections may timeout on slow networks (increases reconnection logic)
- Large batch processing (>16 images) may require memory optimization

### Migration Notes
- This is the initial release - no migration required
- Default configuration optimized for H100/H200 GPUs
