# MCP Server Implementation Summary

## Overview
I've successfully implemented a complete MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for the H200 Intelligent Mug Positioning System. This embedded server exposes the mug positioning capabilities as tools that can be accessed by external systems through a standardized A2A protocol.

## Components Created

### 1. Core Server (`server.py`)
- Full MCP v1.0 protocol implementation
- Supports both WebSocket (port 8765) and HTTP (port 8766) connections
- Handles individual and batch requests
- Real-time streaming via WebSocket
- Comprehensive error handling and statistics tracking

### 2. Authentication System (`auth.py`)
- JWT token authentication with configurable expiration
- API key authentication with metadata storage
- Rate limiting per client with configurable windows
- Scope-based authorization
- Decorator-based protection for tools

### 3. Tool Implementations (`tools.py`)
Four main tools exposed:

#### analyze_image
- Accepts base64-encoded images
- Performs object detection and scene analysis
- Returns mug positions and suggestions
- Supports confidence thresholds and embedding returns

#### apply_rules
- Accepts natural language positioning rules
- Validates and stores rules with priorities
- Supports tags and validation-only mode
- Integrates with the rule engine

#### get_suggestions
- Analyzes scene context for positioning improvements
- Supports multiple strategies (safety_first, balanced, efficiency, aesthetic)
- Returns confidence-scored suggestions
- Applies stored rules automatically

#### update_positioning
- Processes user feedback on suggestions
- Updates positioning recommendations
- Optionally triggers model retraining
- Calculates improvement scores

### 4. Protocol Models (`models.py`)
- Complete Pydantic models for all MCP data structures
- Request/Response models with validation
- Batch request support
- Streaming chunk models
- Capability reporting structures

### 5. Client Implementation (`client.py`)
- Full-featured async client for MCP server
- Supports both HTTP and WebSocket connections
- Convenience methods for all tools
- Batch request support
- Real-time streaming capabilities

### 6. FastAPI Integration (`integration.py`)
- Seamless integration with the H200 control plane
- Lifecycle management for the MCP server
- RESTful endpoints for MCP operations
- Token and API key generation endpoints

### 7. Testing Suite (`test_mcp.py`)
- Comprehensive unit tests for all components
- Authentication and authorization tests
- Tool execution tests
- Integration flow tests
- Rate limiting verification

### 8. Example Usage (`example.py`)
- Runnable demo of server and client
- Shows all major features
- Includes authentication examples
- Demonstrates real-world usage patterns

## Key Features

### Security
- Multiple authentication methods (JWT, API Key)
- Rate limiting with configurable windows
- Scope-based access control
- Input validation on all endpoints
- TLS support ready

### Performance
- Async execution throughout
- Batch processing support
- Connection pooling
- Efficient WebSocket streaming
- GPU operation optimization

### Monitoring
- Real-time statistics tracking
- Health check endpoints
- Prometheus-compatible metrics
- Structured logging throughout
- Error tracking and reporting

### Flexibility
- Tool discovery mechanism
- Configurable timeouts
- Multiple transport protocols
- Extensible tool system
- Easy integration patterns

## Integration Points

1. **With FastAPI**: The MCP server can be embedded in the main API using the integration module
2. **With Control Plane**: WebSocket connections enable real-time updates
3. **With External Systems**: Standard protocols allow any system to connect
4. **With Monitoring**: Built-in metrics and health checks

## Usage Examples

### Starting the Server
```python
from src.core.mcp import MCPServer

server = MCPServer(host="0.0.0.0", port=8765)
await server.initialize()
await server.start()
```

### Using the Client
```python
from src.core.mcp import MCPClient

async with MCPClient(auth_token="your-token") as client:
    result = await client.analyze_image(image)
    suggestions = await client.get_suggestions(result['detections'])
```

### Creating Tokens
```python
authenticator = MCPAuthenticator()
token = authenticator.generate_jwt_token(
    client_id="my-app",
    scopes=["analyze", "suggest"]
)
```

## Next Steps

The MCP server is now fully functional and ready for:
1. Integration with the main H200 API
2. Deployment alongside the control plane
3. External system connections
4. Performance optimization based on usage patterns
5. Additional tool development as needed

All components follow the project's coding standards, include proper error handling, and are fully documented.
